# Console based Cpp Programs
Contains some useful C++ Programs, developed through DevC++ during my 2nd semester at University.

**Personal Advice:** Learn C++11 as it covers the gaps & issues we normally face in old C++. Also, it introduces Functional Programming, which becomes very helpful in learning Concurrent/Parallel Programming (i.e. C++11 provides advance thread support libraries). Furthermore, C++11 have introduced Move-Semantics which heavily optimizes your code. Unlike C++14/17, it is way easier and has pretty much the same syntax as old C++, which allows you to quickly adapt its environment.
